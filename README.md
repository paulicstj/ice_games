EDA, Statistical analysis, Hypothesis Testing
You work for the online store Ice, which sells video games worldwide. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g., Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available in open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game is successful or not. This will allow you to identify promising projects and plan advertising campaigns.

In front of you is data dating back to 2016. Let's imagine it's December 2016, and you're planning a campaign for 2017.

The dataset contains a "rating" column that stores each game's ESRB rating. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating of either Teen or Mature.
